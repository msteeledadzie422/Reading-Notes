# Context API

*1. What can React Context provide your app?*
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.


*2. Why might we use Context?*
Context is designed to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.


*3. Why should we use it sparingly?*

Context is applied sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

For this reason, Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.
