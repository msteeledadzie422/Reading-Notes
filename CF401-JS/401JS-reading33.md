# What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

*1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?*
Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.


*2. Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.*
Through RBAC, you can control what end-users can do at both broad and granular levels. For example, an admin user might be able to create, read, update, or delete another user.


*3. What are the Benefits of RBAC?*

1. Reducing administrative work and IT support. with RBAC, you reduce the need for paperwork and password changes when an employee is hired or changes their role - instead you use RBAC to add and switch roles quickly and implement them globally across operating systems, platforms, and applications.
2. Maximizing Operational efficiency. RBAC offers a streamlined approach that is logical in definition. Instead of trying to administer lower-level access control, all the roles can be aligned with the organizational structure of the business and users can do their jobs more efficiently and autonomously.
3. Improving compliance. With an RBAC system in place, companies can more easily meet statutory and regularoty requirements for privacy and confidentiality as IT departments and executives have the ability to manage how data is being access and used.


# react-cookie library vs. react-cookies library

*1. Describe some react-cookie features.*
It allows you to set user cookies and access and modify cookies using React hooks.


*2. Describe some react-cookies features.*
Similar to react-cookie, react-cookies allows you to create isomorphic cookies - you are able to access user cookies while server-rendering.


*3. Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why?*

I would likely use react-cookie because it does not contain Regex (I am not partial to Regex just yet).
