# Hooks and Context exmaple

*1. With regard to the React Context API, what does a “provider” do?*
A context provider is responsible for displaying the local state of an object, and for exposing an API for globally managing them. 


*2. With regard to the React Context API, how would we implement a “consumer” role?*
A custom hook can be used to wrap the useContext internal React hook, which consumes our new context.

We use Custom Hooks as wrappers around internal React hooks.
