  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availabiliity, security, and performance. 


_2. Name some use cases for Amazon S3._ 

  1/ Build a data lake - run big analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and high performance computing applications
  2/ Back up and restore critical data - meet recovery time objectives, recovery point objectives, and compliance requirements
  3/ Archive data at the lowest cost - move data archives to the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes to lower costs, eliminate operational complexities, and gain new insights
  4/ Run cloud-native applications - build fast, powerful mobile and web-based cloud-native apps that scale automatically in a highly available configuration.


_3. Name some benefits of using Amazon S3._

  With cost-effective storage classes and easy-to-use management features, you can optimize costs, organize data, and configure fine-tuned access controls to meet specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.


# AWS Lambda Basics

_1. What is AWS Lambda?_

  AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services. Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.


_2. Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas._

  1/ Scalable APIs - when building APIs using AWS Lambda, one execution of a Lambda function can serve a single HTTP request. Different parts of the API can be routed to different Lambda functions according to the demand for them.
  2/ Data processing - Lambda functions are optimized for event-based data processing. It is easy to integrate AWS Lambda with datasources like Amazon DynamoDB and trigger a Lambda function for specific kinds of data events.


_3. Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend._

  The concept of "serverless" computing refers to not needing to maintain your own servers to run these functions. AWS Lambda is a fully managed service that takes care of all the infrastructure for you. "Serverless" does not mean tha there are no servers involved. It just means that the servers, the operating systems, the network layer and the rest of the infrastructure have already been taken care of, so that you can focus on writing application code. 


# CDN

_1. What is a CDN?_

  A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.


_2. How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?_

  CDNs work through servers nearest to the website visitor respodn to the request. The content delivery network copies the pages of a website to a network of servers that are spread out at geographically different locations, caching the contents of the page.


_3. What are the benefits of employing a CDN?_

  Employing CDN doesn't only speed up the delivery of Internet content, it helps protect your website against certain forms of cyber attacks, such as Denial of Service attacks. It protects against these threats because CDNs allow for the handling of more traffic and withstanding hardware failure better than many origin servers.
