# JS Canvas

1. The canvas element allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript

2. Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesn’t support the <canvas> element
  
3. The getContext() takes one argument which is the type of context. For example, you use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface

2. It might be an easier/more flexible way to display the data
