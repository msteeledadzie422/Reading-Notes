# Structure Pages with HTML

Wireframing is creating a visual outline of the web page you are looking to design.

You create all of the boxes you are looking to render and how you would like them laid out and displayed on the page.

There are 6 important steps in creating your Wireframe:
1. Do your research
2. Prepare your research for reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don't draw. Sketch, don't illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

## What is HTML?

HTML is a mark*up* language that defines the structure of your content.

More nuanced syntax than Mark*down*, HTML has established syntax for each section of your page you are looking to create.

*Semantics* are also very important in HTML as these determine the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".).
