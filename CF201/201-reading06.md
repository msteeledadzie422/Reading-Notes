# Javascript Object Basics

1. An object is any element within code that holds (or can hold) a value. These can consist of one variable, or several variables that may even change depending on anything you may need to do with that variable or data.

2. Object Literals are helpful when you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put into a database. Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually

3. Objects are typically easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name. 

4. One useful aspect of bracket notation is that it can be used to set not only member values dynamically, but member names too

5. This refers to the object const dog. When you only have to create a single object literal, it's not so useful. But if you create more than one, this enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create.

# Introduction to the Dom

1. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

2. The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites. JavaScript can also be used in other contexts. For example, Node.js runs JavaScript programs on a computer, but provides a different set of APIs, and the DOM API is not a core part of the Node.js runtime. The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.
