# Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Syntax Error: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
   Logic Error: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

2. 404 errors and errors with missing semi colons!

3. This is so helpfuly in getting Code to successfully run, will definitely be using this a lot in the future!

# The JavaScript Debugger

1. Every modern web browser includes a powerful suite of developer tools. These tools do a range of things, from inspecting currently-loaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showing which assets the page has requested and how long they took to load

2. The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly

3. The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
