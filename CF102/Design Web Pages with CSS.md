# What is CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows the user specify how their ddocument should be presented to users - style, layout, color, etc.

CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

CSS elements are enclosed with Curly Brackets

There are three ways to insert CSS into your document:
1. External CSS - change just one file and make updates to any websites
2. Internal CSS - make styles changes to one specific document
3. Inline CSS - make styles changes to one specific line of code
