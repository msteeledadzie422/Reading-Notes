# Text Editors

A Text Editor is a type of software that can be downloaded that allows you to write and manage text on your website

Some of the most important features to consider when choosing a text editor are:

- Code completion
- Syntax highlighting
- Variety of themes
- Healthy selection of extensions

Every computer comes with its own Text Editor already installed, and it is up to the user to decide which Text Editor to acquire from there.

Third-Party Text Editor options include:

- NotePad++
- TextWrangler/BB Edit
- Visual Studio Code
- Atom
- Brackets
- Sublime Text

## Text Editors vs. IDEs

Compared to a Text Editor, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a suite of software all coming together: a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
