##Loops and Iteration

Loops allow us to take an action and execute it repeatedly. 

Loops should be thought of as computerized versions of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. 

The main statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

- for statement
- do...while statement
- while statement
- labeled statement
- break statement
- continue statement
- for...in statement
- for...of statement
