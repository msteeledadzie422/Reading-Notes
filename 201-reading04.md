# Creating Hyperlinks

To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside an **<a> element** and using the **href attribute**.

The **href attribute** contains the **web address**.

Below are a few best practices to ensure links are accessible to all readers:
  - Use clear link wording and keep in mind that:
      - Reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context
      - Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to
      - Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links. They will find descriptive link text useful
  - Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text
  - Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text
  - Keep your link text as short as possible
  - Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places
  
# CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

**Normal Flow** refers to the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout. 

Below are a few differencess between _block-level_ and _inline_ elements:
  - By default, block-level elements are laid out in the block flow direction, which is based on the parent's writing mode (initial: horizontal-tb). Each element will appear on a new line below the last one, with each one separated by whatever margin that's been specified. In English, for example, (or any other horizontal, top to bottom writing mode) block-level elements are laid out vertically
  - Inline elements, however, do not appear on new lines. Instead, they sit on the same line along with any adjacent (or wrapped) text content as long as there is space for them to do so inside the width of the parent block level element. If there is not space, then the overflowing content will move down to a new line
  
**Static positioning** is the default for every html element.

Below are a few useful applications of **absolute positioning**:
  - An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow - instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. This allows us to create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page.
  - _top_, _bottom_, _left_, and _right_ behave differently with absolute positioning. Rather than positioning the element based on its relative position within the normal document flow, they specify the distance the element should be from each of the containing element's sides
  
A key difference between **fixed positioning** and **absolute positioning** is that, whereas _absolute positioning_ fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), _fixed positioning_ usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport

# JS: Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

A function **declaration** is the process of creating or _defining_ the function, whereas function **invocation** is what is used to actually have a function run. This is done by including the name of the function somewhere in the code, followed by parentheses

A **parameter** is a value that needs to be included inside some function parentheses in order for the function to do its job properly. 

An **argument** is passed into a function to meet that functions specified parameter. Parameters are also sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes.

Below are two benefits of **Pair Programming**:

1. Two heads are better than one! You are sometimes able to more easily come up with ideas, or arrive at ideas faster, when with a partner
2. Accountability: you can be held more accountable when you are working with a partner!
