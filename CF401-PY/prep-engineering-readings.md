# Engineering Readings

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
    Perseverence and a never say quit mentality in the face of obstacles. I need to be better at being in a team, but I do very much enjoy getting a team through obstacles.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
    1. Take a walk - I very much enjoy taking a walk to clear my head, and I find this usualy helps me look at problems in new ways
    2. Start working on a different part of the problem - I used to do this when writing essays. If I could not think of what to write for a particular part of the essay. I would begin to think about what I might write for another part of the essay, and that usually helped unblock me fairly quickly.
    3. Speak with others - I am not always the best about conversing with others when I am stuck, but I think hearing others' perspective is a great way to become unstuck.
