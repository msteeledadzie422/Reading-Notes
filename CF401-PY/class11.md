# Data Analysis

1. _What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?_
    JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.


2. _What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?_
    With NumPy, we work with multidimensional arrays. You can use Numpy to read files, index arrays, slice arrays, and assign values within arrays. 


3. _Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them._
    We can create a NumPy array using the numpy.array function.  If we pass in a list of lists, it will automatically create a NumPy array with the same number of rows and columns.
    
    We can slice an array using a colon: a colon indicates that we want to select all the elements from the starting index up to but not including the ending index.
    
    We can also use indexing to assign values to certain elements in arrays. We can do this by assigning directly to the indexed value.
