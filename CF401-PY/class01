# Pain and Suffering

1. My perspective is that of someone coming from a business background looking to make the transition to Software Development. I have always enjoyed and had an affinity for Technology, and I look forward to learning how to actually build that software, bringing this passion to my work.
2. I am doing this because I have always wanted to be fortunate enough to be able to make a transition such as this to gain a skillset I am proud of and that I am happy to use for the rest of my days.
3. I do want what comes at the end of this journey. Code Fellows is a difficult program and I have enjoyed all of the ways in which it has helped me grow.
4. I am doing this for you. It took me a good while to double, triple, and quadruple confirm this, but I can safely say that I am taking this coding leap of faith for myself.

# Beginner's Guide to Big O Notation

- O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
- O(n) describes an algorith whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
- O(n^2) represents an algorith whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
- O(2^n) denotes an algorith whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
- Logarithms:
    - Used for when you are decreasing the size of an input data set as you are iterating through it, flattening out the algorithms time/space as the data set grows.

Notes:
  - Big O favors the worst-case performance scenario
  - An example of an O(2^N) function is the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers
