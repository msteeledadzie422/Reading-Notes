# Data Structures and Algorithms

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
      It depends on the direction your files or data will be moving, how dynamically, and how you may or may not need to access the files or data.
      Another important consideration is the space your algorithm will take up (if you are creating new data structures to solve a problem), and how much time your algorithm will take to move that data.


2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
      To avoid an infinite recursive call stack you need to set a base case that does not make a recursive call. Once this base case is hit, the recursion is ended.
