# Data Structures and Algorithms

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
      Data Structures are a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data         more efficiently. Data structures have a wide and diverse scope of usage across the fields of Computer Science and Software Engineering.

      Below are 8 common data structures:
      
      1. Arrays: An array is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. It can be an array of integers, an array of floating-            point numbers, an array of strings or even an array of arrays (such as 2-dimensional arrays). Arrays are indexed, meaning that random access is            possible.

         Array operations:
         * Traverse: Go through the elements and print them.
         * Search: Search for an element in the array. You can search the element by its value or its index
         * Update: Update the value of an existing element at a given index

         Inserting elements to an array and deleting elements from an array cannot be done straight away as arrays are fixed in size. If you want to                insert an element to an array, first you will have to create a new array with increased size (current size + 1), copy the existing elements and            add the new element. The same goes for the deletion with a new array of reduced size.

         Applications of arrays:
         Used as the building blocks to build other data structures such as array lists, heaps, hash tables, vectors and matrices.
         Used for different sorting algorithms such as insertion sort, quick sort, bubble sort and merge sort.

      2. Linked Lists: A linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other. Hence, you have to access data sequentially and random access is not possible. Linked lists provide a simple and flexible representation of dynamic sets.

Elements in a linked list are known as nodes.
Each node contains a key and a pointer to its successor node, known as next.
The attribute named head points to the first element of the linked list.
The last element of the linked list is known as the tail.






2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
