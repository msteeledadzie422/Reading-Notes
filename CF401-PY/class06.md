# Ten Thousand Game 1

1. _How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?_
      * The randint() function - can be used to create random strings within a range. The function takes two numbers as its input argument. The first input argument is the start of the range and the second input argument is the end of the range.
      * The random() function - used to generate random numbers between 0 and 1. When executed, the random() function returns a floating point number between 0 and 1.
      * The choice() function - used to select a random element from a collection object like a list, set, tuple, etc. The function takes a collection object as its input argument and returns a random element.
      * The shuffle() function - shuffles the elements in the list in place. The shuffle() function takes a list as an input argument. After execution, the elements of the list are shuffled in a random order
      * The randrange() function - used to select a random element from a given range. It takes three numbers namely start, stop, and step as input argument. After execution, it generates a randomly selected element from the range(start, stop, step).
      
2. _In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?_
      In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.
      
      The key steps to Risk Analysis in Software Development are Risk Identification and Risk Assessment.
      
      There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process:
        1. Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.
        2. Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.
        3. Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required
        4. Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.
        
      There are three assessments on Risk Assessment:
        1. Effect: To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.
        2. Cause: To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.
        3. Likelihood: To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement wonâ€™t be satisfied.

3. _What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing?_
