# The Growth Mindset

This past year I have taken to learn how to Code has been one of the greatest undertakings of my life. Learning as an adult is no mean feat.

I think Code Fellows consistent messaging around the difficulty of what we are doing and the consistent message to be kind to ourselves is so critical to having success in this course and beyond.

I scored below a 18 on all categories except Social Awareness. Emotional Intelligence is an area in which I greatly need to improve. Looking to be a better partner and teammate.


## Bias Self-Assessment

I scored a 101/120 which indicates self-awareness, curiosity, and courage but the learning and growth never stops! I most definitely have room to improve in this and all areas.
