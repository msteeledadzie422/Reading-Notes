1. _What is the purpose of dunder methods in Python? Provide an example of a commonly used dunder method._
    Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. A common example of a dunder method is slicing. You can implement a __getitem__ method which allows you to use Python's list slicing syntax: obj[start:stop].


2. _In the video “AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course,” what was the main ethical issue raised concerning the use of developers’ work, and how might this have been avoided?_
    Viraj lied about how many students would be in the course - he said that there would be a max of 500 students in the course so that each student could receive personal instruction, but he lied and created two classes. One class had 770 students and one class had 500 students - much more than he claimed.
    
    The students eventually revolted and demanded a refund. 


3. _Describe the Python statistics module and give an example of a function within the module that can be used to perform a common statistical operation._
    You can use the random function to generate a chosen random number of trials to determine an average given output, assigning a probability to that output.
