# NOSQL vs. SQL

1. SQL: 1/ databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS), 2/ databases are table based databases, 3/ databases have predefined schema, 4/ databases are vertically scalable, 5/ databases use SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful.
   NOSQL: 1/ databases are primarily called as non-relational or distributed databases, 2/ databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores, 3/ databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data, 4/ databases are horizontally scalable, 5/ queries are focused on collection of documents.
2. Structured data is a good fit for a SQL database.
3. MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL are all real world SQL databases.
4. Unstructured data is a good fit for a NOSQL database.
5. MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb are all real world NOSQL databases.
6. NOSQL databases fit better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
7. NOSQL databases are better for scalability because they are horizontally scalable, which allows you to easily add more servers to your NOSQL database infrastructure to handle large traffic vs. a SQL database which is vertically scalable and require increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc. on a single server.

# SQL vs. NOSQL

1. SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
2. A relational database has a strict structure on how you can input and receive data from that database.
3. A relational database works with table data structures. 
4. A schema is a set of requirements for the data to be stored in a database.
5. A NOSQL database is built to store lots and lots of data in an unstructured way.
6. A NOSQL database stores data in terms of collections and are much more flexibile with data.
7. Collections are inside a Mongo database.
8. The flexibility of each database depends on the type of data you are looking to store.
9. If you have highly structured data, you may need to update several aspects/places of your NOSQL database if any changes occur, vs. a SQL database where you will likely only need to update a few aspects of your database.
