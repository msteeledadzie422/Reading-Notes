# Markdown Notes

Structuring items on a Markdown page is controlled by **Syntax**

Syntax determines what appears on your page, and in what capacity.

For example, creating Headings on your page is done by using the # sign in Markdown in front of a word or phrase. - "# Header," for example.

Similarly, font adjustments have their own Syntax - bolding a word, for example, requires placing two asterisks on either side of the word or phrase you are looking to bold: "**bold**."

You can learn more about some of the basic syntax available in Markdown at the links [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). 

Enjoy learning Markdown my friends!
