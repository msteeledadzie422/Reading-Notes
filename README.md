Hello! My name is Mandela Steele-Dadzie, you can find my GitHub portfolio [here](https://github.com/msteeledadzie422).

To me, a **Growth Mindset** is persevering through failure -- the opposite of thinking that something may not be "for you" because it does not work out for you right away.

A person with a Growth Mindset may be more inclined to: 
  - Attempt to learn a new skill or pick up a new hobby
  - "Dust themselves off and try again"
  - Welcome help and advice knowing they always have room to improve

I believe the below quote also speaks to this mindset:

> *"Live as if you were to die tomorrow; learn as if you were to live forever"*
>
> Mahatma Gandhi

Whatever mindset you have, persevere!
