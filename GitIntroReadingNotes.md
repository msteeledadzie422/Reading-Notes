# The Importance of Version Control

Version Control allows you to revisit previous versions of a file or files by recording changes. This allows teams to better collaborate across projects.

## Centralized vs. Distributed Version Control

- **Centralized Version Control**: this system entails a single serviers storing all changes and file versions
- **Distributed Version Control**: addresses the vulnerability of a centralized system (the single point of failure) and creates mirrored repositories so that programmers are able to work in teams

Working in Git allows you to clone pages you are working on in GitHub in order to "bring them down" to your computer so you are able to work on projects offline or off-VPN.

Once changes are complete on your computer, you are able to "push" the changes you completed in Git up to the GitHub platform so that both versions of the file you are working on are in sync.
